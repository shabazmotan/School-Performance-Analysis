Summary -  

The goal is to help school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on district-side standardized test results. Aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. There are a total of 15 schools and 39,170 students. The total budget is $24,649,428. The average math score is 78.99%, average reading score is 81.88%, students passing math is 74.98%, and students passing reading is 85.81%. The overall passing rate is 80.39%.

Conclusions - 

* As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
